                    <h3>Instructions:</h3>

                        <li>In a large pot, bring the water to a boil. Gradually add the maize flour while stirring continuously to avoid lumps. Cook until the mixture thickens and pulls away from the sides of the pot. Reduce heat and let it simmer for a few minutes. Remove from heat and cover to keep warm.</li>
                        <li>In a separate pan, heat vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and saut√© until they become translucent.</li>
                        <li>Add the minced garlic and ginger to the pan and cook for another minute until fragrant.</li>
                        <li>Add the beef cubes to the pan and cook until they are browned on all sides.</li>
                        <li>Add the chopped tomatoes to the pan and cook until they soften and form a sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                        <li>Reduce the heat and let the beef simmer in the sauce for about 30-40 minutes or until tender. You can add a little water if needed to keep it from drying out.</li>
                        <li>Serve the beef stew alongside the ugali. Enjoy your meal!</li>
